            <h2 class="card-title">Darjeeling Trip</h2>
            <p class="card-text"> I went to Darjeeling with my friends and what a mesmarising experience. At the foothills of the Himalayas, Darjeeling stands proudly. A backpacker’s delight and a honeymooner’s dream, Darjeeling is an unembellished canvas of natural beauty. Alluring visitors with its sprawling expanse of green set against the white of majestic snow-capped peaks, Darjeeling’s panoramas are captivating in every way. It only takes one visit to the ‘queen of the hills’ to fall in love! 

			Don’t leave Darjeeling before you

		 Ghoom Monastery: With prayer flags fluttering around its premises, the Ghoom Monastery houses a towering 15-feet high statue of the Maitreya Buddha. Amongst the oldest monasteries in Darjeeling, Ghoom also houses old Buddhist manuscripts. 

Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park: Most noted for being the only zoo in India to foster a conservation programme for endangered species of animals including red pandas, snow leopards and the Tibetan wolf, Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park spans over 67 acres. The largest high altitude zoo in India, the zoo is home to fauna and flora unique to the Himalayan region. 

Japanese Peace Pagoda: Situated on Jalapahar Hill at a height of over 28 metres, the Peace Pagoda in Darjeeling is also known as the Nipponzan Myohoji Buddhist Temple. The premises of the Japanese Peace Pagoda are equally serene as is the interior of the temple, which showcases the four forms of Lord Buddha.

Mahakal Temple: At the summit of Observatory Hill, the Mahakal Temple is where Buddhism and Hinduism come together. This is where the original Bhutia Busty monastery was located and where the Mahakal Temple stands now. The sound of monks and priests chanting fills the air as you climb about a 100 steps to get to the temple. While admiring the colourful prayer flags that guide the way, beware of greedy monkeys around you!

Darjeeling Mall, Chowrasta:  The heart and soul of Darjeeling town, the Darjeeling Mall, Chowrasta is a meeting and recreational point for locals and tourists alike. The hustle and bustle is undeniable with shops and restaurants lining the street. Benches along the periphery offer great vantage points to admire the surrounding scenery.
